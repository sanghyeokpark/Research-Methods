<b>Assignment Prompt</b>: You recently ran a lab experiment. Before starting the experiment half of the subjects were randomly assigned to read an article about ethical issues in AI. Then, all subjects were asked to read a business case about the use of AI in management. All subjects they were asked if they would recommend adopting AI in management (yes/no). 
<p>
Your assignment is to create a publication-quality table of the effect of the reading assignment on AI adoption recommendations. This repository contains Stata code to perform the analysis, output the table and add it to a document. It contains these exampes both for LaTeX and Word/Excel.
